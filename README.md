# go-topaz-ui

The package exposes the ui handlers and the static embedded FS used in Topaz for the console service configuration.

The static console files in this repository are based on the [self-hosted-console](https://github.com/orgs/aserto-dev/packages/container/package/self-hosted-console) container.

Use `mage fetch` command to get the console files that are embedded in this module.
